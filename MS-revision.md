## Computational Plate Tectonics and the Geological Record in the Continents

Earth scientists recently celebrated the fifty-year anniversary of the theory of plate tectonics. The notion that the Earth’s surface is composed of a small number of slowly but continually-moving ‘rigid’ plates floating on a convecting, fluid interior is now firmly established as the foundational concept of the discipline, and routinely observable, thanks to space geodesy, as seen in Figure 1


~~Earth Scientists recently celebrated the fifty year anniversary of the theory of Plate Tectonics. The notion that the Earth's surface is composed of a small number of slowly, but continually, moving 'rigid' plates floating on a convecting, fluid interior is now firmly established as the foundation concept of the discipline. Thanks to space geodesy, those motions are now routinely observable and I have illustrated them in the map in Figure 1. In that map, I have also plotted the second invariant of the strain-rate which is clearly vanishingly small in the plate interiors and large at the plate boundaries.~~

If the plates can be considered rigid, then they are merely boundary conditions on a global circulation problem. The theory of plate tectonics is actually a kinematic description of plate motion that describes how the plates move, but it does not tell us why they move as they do. Neither does it explain how and why new boundaries form or show what happens in the continental regions where deformation is more diffuse. We don’t know how or when plate tectonics began, or why plate motions are only observed on Earth and not on other planets or moons in the solar system. Addressing these questions requires a fully-dynamic theory of plate motion and constitutive behaviour.

![A map of  surface velocities shows that the surface motions are organised into a strikingly simple pattern of surface “plates” that are almost rigid bodies. The surface strain rate–coloured contours—is concentrated at the plate boundaries. The map also displays the second invariant of the strain-rate, which is vanishingly small in the plate interiors and large at the plate boundaries. Closer inspection reveals that there are many regions within the continental crust where the motions are diffuse, not at all plate-like. The arrows are colored by their angle to ‘North’ as a means of distinguishing the different plates. The scale is such that the longest vector represents 10cm/yr. ](Figures/StrainRatePlateMotions.png)

~~Figure 1. The surface of the Earth is continually moving in response to convection currents in the underlying mantle. A map of the surface velocities shows the motions are organised into a strikingly simple pattern of surface "plates" that are almost rigid bodies.

The contours of the strain rate in Figure 1 show some regions where plate boundaries are relatively diffuse,  (meaning that the plates are not rigid here). Many of these regions occur in the continents - particularly obvious is the regional deformation associated with the collision of India and Eurasia which produces the Himalayan mountain belt. The realization that the plates are not rigid is the first step towards addressing one of the most enduring and significant challenges facing the Earth sciences: the development of a coupled model of deep circulation, plate motions, and continental deformation.

 ~~In Figure 1, I have deliberately chosen contours of the strain rate to show that there are some regions where the plate boundaries are relatively diffuse (which is the same thing as saying that there are places where the plates are not rigid). Many of these occur in the continents - particularly obvious is the regional deformation associated with the collision of India and Eurasia which produces the Himalayan mountain belt. The realization that the plates are not rigid is the first step towards one of the most enduring and significant challenge facing the Earth Sciences, namely, a coupled model of deep circulation, plate motions and continental deformation.~~

Developing a global circulation model for the solid Earth is a grand challenge problem. Rheology, the study of flow of matter, is very non-linear and history-dependent because it represents processes that occur at a much smaller temporal and spatial scale than plate movement. Such processes include the mechanics of slip-on fault formation through the accumulated effect of thousands of small earthquakes (see Figure 2), and the effects of grain-scale deformation and melting of minerals that constitute rocks.

~~There are two reasons why a global circulation model for the solid Earth is a grand challenge problem. The first is that rheology is very non-linear and history dependent (see ["Modelling Large Scale Flow"](#modelinglarge-scaleflow) below) because it represents processes which occur at a much smaller temporal and spatial scale than the plates. Such processes include the mechanics of formation and slip on faults through the accumulated effect of thousands of small earthquakes (see Figure 2), and the effects of grain-scale deformation and melting of the minerals from which the rocks are constituted.~~

Another aspect of the grand challenge is determining how to find and use observations which can constrain the many additional degrees of freedom required by large-scale, dynamic circulation models. Appreciating the scale of this challenge requires recognition of the fundamental difference between the geological record of the ocean floor (the plates) and the geological record of the continental crust. The oceanic crust is part of the three-dimensional, deep circulation pattern of the solid Earth, with an overturn time r of around 100 million years,  comparable to the median age of the oceanic plates. The continental crust is buoyant enough to escape large-scale recycling and much more widely-distributed in age (ranging up to over three billion years).

The continental crust is buoyant enough to escape large-scale recycling and is much more widely distributed in age (ranging up to 3+ billion years). The continental record may be longer, but it is an indirect record.~~

Consider, for example, the Himalayan mountain belt, which is the result of subduction zone congestion by the buoyant and deformable continental crust. The deformation results in the dramatic topography of the region as the crust is shortened and thickened (Sse Figure 3, and  view an accompanying movie at sinews.siam.org). Examining the stratigraphy, cooling history, and metamorphism of the rocks allows one to infer the history of the uplifted surface, which is recorded by rocks in crumpled and overturned units. It is also indirectly recorded in the sedimentary record as rivers and glaciers carry material away from the mountain belts and into sedimentary basins.

In sedimentary basins,  the accumulated detritus of an age is safely stashed away, roughly in descending order from youngest to oldest. The difficulty in inverting the detritus to reveal the history of geological deformation is that the transport of eroded sediment can occur over long distances, is very dependent on the history of the topography, can be quite variable in time and space, is sensitive to very small-scale processes, and is coupled to the large-scale deformation. For example, the lengthy, tortuous pathways that the major rivers draining the Himalayas often take to reach the ocean are very obviously influenced by changes to the topography as the streams and rivers cut their channels.

~~Sedimentary basins are to geologists what rubbish tips are to archeologists: places where the accumulated detritus of an age is safely stashed away, roughly in order from youngest at the top to oldest at the bottom. The difficulty in inverting such a signal to tell us about the history of geological deformation is that the transport of eroded sediment can occur over long distances, is very dependent on the history of the topography, can be very variable in time and space, is sensitive to very small-scale processes and is coupled to the large scale deformation. This is immediately obvious looking at a map of the major rivers which drain the himalayas (Figure 2). The lengthy, tortuous pathways they often take to reach the ocean are very obviously influenced by changes to the topography occurring as the streams and rivers cut their channels.

~~### Discussion~~

 - [ ] Todo: This sentence is out of context now that it is not the discussion

While global circulation models  are needed to bring the power of plate tectonic theory to the continental geological record, making these models meaningful will require embedding models which can reproduce observable aspects of the continental record.

~~Global circulation models for the solid Earth are needed to bring the power of plate tectonic theory to the continental geological record. However, to make these models meaningful, they will have to embed models which can reproduce observable aspects of that continental record. That this is a grand challenge problem is amply illustrated by considering just one of those observables: the effect of weather at the surface in driving erosion and transport of sediment.~~

~~### Modeling Large-Scale Flow~~

 - [ ] Todo: this needs a proper intro

Solving a simplified system of equations is necessary to model the flow in the mantle and the plates’ response. A typical template for this problem uses the Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid (or nearly so) driven by thermal buoyancy due to planetary cooling and deep radioactive decay:

<!-- Need some math mode stuff before these equations will be detected -->

    \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} - \nabla p  = g \rho  \hat{z}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{D T}{D t} = \nabla( \kappa \nabla T ) + Q
    \label{eq:advdiff}
\end{equation}

Silicate rocks deform as an extremely high-viscosity fluid over geological time, which eliminates the need to consider the effects of inertia and rotation. However, a significant complexity arises from the rheology, which is strongly dependent on deformation history and composition.

The second term in the constitutive law (4) (in red) is the effect of viscoelasticity, and the third term represents the effects of faulting and other forms of material failure as a non-isotropic and strain-dependent plasticity. Neglecting elastic stresses is common at the large length and time scale of these models, but plate boundaries are represented through the plasticity term and these are central to the formulation.

The most successful algorithms for dealing with the elliptic Stokes equation and the history-dependent rheology are hybrids with an Eulerian mesh suitable to build an efficient, parallel, multigrid solver for (1 ) and Lagrangian particles embedded in the fluid which record the stress and strain history required for (4 ). In the  Underworld code (REF), the particle properties map to the mesh via a finite element quadrature rule that must be constructed on-the-fly for the distribution of particles found in each element at every timestep.

~~### Coupling to Sediment Transport Models~~

![**Figure 4** - Idealised erosion, transport and deposition models are based on computing height changes which depend on local slope, those dependent on long-range transport processes by rivers or glaciers, and motions due to large-scale tectonics. Long-range transport by rivers requires us to know information integrated from the entire upstream catchment of every point. Erosion tends to localise, whereas deposition has the opposite characteristic (1, 2). Upstream integrals can be calculated very efficiently with an appropriately ordered traversal of the graph of downhill-connectivity of the surface (3, 4). Parallel algorithms based on arbitrary spatial decompositions of the domain disrupt this efficient ordering.](Figures/SurfaceProcess.png)


\begin{equation}
    \frac{D h}{D t} =
    \color{Red} { \nabla\left( \kappa(h) \nabla h \right) } -
    \color{Blue}{ K A ^ m \left| h \right| ^n + \dot  h_\mathrm{basement} }
    \label{eq:surfaceprocess}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    A = \\! \\! \\! \\! \int \limits _ { \xi, \mathrm{upstream}} \\!\\!\\!\\! \alpha ( \xi )

\end{equation}


Geologists can limit the discussion of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition to those that are most likely to be important at scales of hundreds of kilometers and hundreds of thousands to millions of years. Consider the changing height of a simple surface described by h(x(t), y(t )), with the simplified description outlined in the equation (5 ). The time derivative of the surface height is computed as a balance between local, non-linear, diffusion-like terms (red) and non-local terms related to the integrated upstream area for any point (6 ). Such terms occur because, for example, the available energy of a river in eroding the basement is expected to relate to both the local slope and the total amount of water in the river. To know how much sediment a river is carrying, the net erosion rate upstream must be known for every point along the river. Figure 4 illustrates the network resulting from downhill flow pathway for a discrete set of points representing the surface, and how integrating (5 ) produces a tree-like collection of pathways which cut into the surface. Such pathways form narrow, localised channels that can be very stable. However, where deposition occurs (when the energy of the flow decreases in a flatter region, for example) then the reverse is true: flows tend to diverge, developing multiple pathways across low-relief surfaces. It is much harder to apply the ordered traversal of a tree that is diverging in this way. A promising approach in this case, which is also efficient for domain-decomposed parallel computation, is to use repeated applications of the adjacency matrix of the downhill-directed graph corresponding to the flow network. Such approaches are needed when the surface is not modelled in isolation but as part of a large computation, such as the one shown in Figure 3
